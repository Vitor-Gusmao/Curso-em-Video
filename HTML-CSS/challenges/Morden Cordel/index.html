    <p>I'm getting tired
        <br>
        From such technology
        <br>
        We only speak via email
        <br>
        Short and cold message
        <br>
        Twitter and Facebook
        <br>
        Before I expire
        <br>
        I will say everything in poetry.</p>

     <p>It's not like it was before
        <br>
        It's all abbreviated
        <br>
        "You" only has two letters
        <br>
        The "O" and "E" have been crossed out
        <br>
        To declare love
        <br>
        Just put a flower
        <br>
        And a drawn heart.</p>

     <p>Arroba now doesn't weigh
        <br>
        It is part of an address
        <br>
        Full stop is not even used
        <br>
        Or go to the beginning
        <br>
        Now it's .com
        <br>
        If the website is very good
        <br>
        He is worth a high price.</p>
        <p>To make the language worse
            <br>
            The emoticon is a risk
            <br>
            There's a symbol for everything
            <br>
            Semicolon and an asterisk
            <br>
            A kiss means
            <br>
            To understand how it is
            <br>
            Decipher this scribble.</p>

     <p>I miss the letters
        <br>
        Written with your own hand
        <br>
        Sent in June
        <br>
        It only arrived in the summer
        <br>
        But it killed the longing
        <br>
        It was real text
        <br>
        In the lines of the heart.</p>

     <p>Now I write and send
        <br>
        Arriving at the same time
        <br>
        But when I'm going to proceed
        <br>
        The person left
        <br>
        Opened another application
        <br>
        The world was captive
        <br>
        From the technology of now.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, to pray
            <br>
            No internet needed
            <br>
            God listens to everyone
            <br>
            If you want, take this test
            <br>
            Two points are two knees
            <br>
            Your lips are braces
            <br>
            Let God interpret.</p>
