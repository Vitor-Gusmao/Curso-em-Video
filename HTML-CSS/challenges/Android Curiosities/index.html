But perhaps you don't know that your friendly mascot has a very curious name and story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
    <h2>The First Version</h2>
    <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://danmorrill.org" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a> He says he opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The objective was just to personify the system for its team only, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

    <h2>A New Mascot Appears</h2>
    <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. The Russian illustrator <a href="" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a>also a Google employee, she was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

    <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then  Android's new mascot appeared, <span class="greenhighlight">Bugdroid</span>.</p>
    <img class="smallimg" src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid">
    <p>The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's features came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>
